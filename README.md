# LetsCode
Here you can find some **projects that I've designed** as a requirement to earn the Data Science Degree offered by Let's Code programming school.

Some of them were the very first coding lines written by me, so you may find it too simple or too raw. **If you want to see what I've learned so far, please find the most recent ones, they are up-to-date.**

And if you are facing some of these challenges too and think I could help you to get through them, or if you have any questions about my journey on learning Python and Data Science, feel free to contact me :)
