# LetsCode
Here you can find some **projects that I've designed** as a requirement to earn the Data Science Degree offered by Let's Code programming school. They are divided by each subject I've studied so far.

Some of them were the very first coding lines written by me, so you may find it too simple or too raw. **If you want to see what I've learned so far, please find the most recent ones, they are up-to-date.**

Also, some of them are in Portuguese, others are in English. I plan to translate everything to English very soon.

If you think I could help you to get through any similar problems or if you have any questions about my journey on learning Python and Data Science, feel free to contact me :)
